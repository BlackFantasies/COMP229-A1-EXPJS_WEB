                        <p class="display-6">Fraction Calculator Application + GUI</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">This was one of my favorite projects. Generally I am a very anal person and this project challenged me as it only allowed for the calculation of the numerator and denominator but it did not handle invalid input. By adding an additional conditional statement before the number input was accepted, it helped deal with invalid inputs and calculations. </p>

                        <p class="fs-4">The project required for students to collaborate and create documents through the Scrum Development Framework for an application of their choice. Not only was this one of my first experiences interacting with other students but it gave me a glimpse of expectations of a working in a professional environment but it allowed me to see the process of how software is developed from the beginning.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">The project was an accumulative of everything taught about object oriented programming. This project required us to create an application for a bank teller to perform transactions for customer accounts. Through the use of parent-child classes and instantiations of class methods and values, we were able to create customer accounts, search, view, withdraw, and deposit money from their respective account stored on a list.</p>
